<h1>Data Wrangling</h1>

<p>Dogs are known to be loyal, friendly, and fluffy.
Those are some of the valuable things about dogs, but what WeRateDogs thinks?</p>

<h3>In this project we will go through three steps of data wrangling:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gatharing</li>
<li>Assesting</li>
<li>Cleaning</li>
</ul>
<h3>To answer three questions</h3>
<h4>1.which is the most liked name in the data?</h4>
<h4>2.what is the most dog name used?</h4>
<h4>3.what is the most kind of dogs predicted?</h4>

<h3>Keep in mind that there is 3 resourses of data used here which are included in the project</h3>

<h2>Enjoy :) </h2>
